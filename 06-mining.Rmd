# Mining the intersectional structure of a population


Using a fonction, we can apply this analysis in several exposures or health outcomes. For example, in our population, we estimated the ICC of strata (48) for several environmental, economic, social, stress exposures and behaviours; and the contribution of each category and intersectional effect when the ICC was above 5%. 

The results has been plotted here:
