# About

Disclaimer: Here, I'm not going back over the theory and concepts involved in intersectional quantative analysis and MAIDHA models. This is simply a sharing of scripts to simplify the implementation of this type of analysis in epidemiology.

We were largely inspired by the work of Evans et al (for example: @evans2024tutorial) and the vignette in the [ggeffects]:https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/practical_intersectionality.html package.
